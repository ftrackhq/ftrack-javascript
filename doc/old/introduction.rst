Introduction
************

The JavaScript API client allows developers to write JavaScript scripts,
running in a web browser, that talk directly with an ftrack server. The scripts
can perform operations against that server depending on granted permissions.

This documentation focuses the JavaScript client. More information about the
API in general can be found at :ref:`server documentation
<ftrack:developing/api>`. It may also be useful to look at the documentation
for the
`Python client <http://rtd.ftrack.com/docs/ftrack-python-api/en/stable/>`_.

The JavaScript API client is still in active development. Please file an issue
if you find something that is not working correctly. Feedback is also more than
welcome.
